Q: (China) 16 students took part in a competition. All problems were multiple choice questions with four choices. Students were required to choose one and only one of the choices for each question. It was said that any two students had at most one answer in common. Find the maximum number of problems.

***

A: 解答: 设共 $m$ 题, 则于 $\forall i$ 题处实现事件 "某两人有相同答案" 之次数至少为 $24$. 据题知 $24m\leq \binom{16}{15}$, 故 $m\leq 5$.

检验: 取等时, 每一题的所有选项在答卷中恰出现 $4$ 次, 任意两人恰有一题相同.
