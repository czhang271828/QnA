Q: $A:=\begin{pmatrix}2&X\\0&2\end{pmatrix}$ is not equivalent to any diagonal matrix.

A: If not, then it is equivalent to some $B:=\mathrm{diag}(p(x),q(x))$. When $A\sim B$ in $\mathbb Z[X]$, the equivalence relation holds in $\mathbb Z[X]/(2,X)$. Thus $B=O$ in $\mathbb Z[X]/(2,X)$, that is, $p(x)q(x)\in (2,X)^2\setminus (0)$. Since $\det (B)$ is a divisor of $\det (A)$, $p(x)=q(x)=2$ is the only solution. Therefore, the only candidate is $B=2I$. However, $A\sim B$ in $\mathbb Z[X]/(2)$, a contradiction!
