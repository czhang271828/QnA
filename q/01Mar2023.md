Q: The [ring of continuous functions](https://planetmath.org/ringofcontinuousfunctions) $C(\Bbb R)$ has an ideal $S=\set{f\in C(\Bbb R):f(0)=0}$. Is $S$ finitely generated?

***

A: First, set $O:C(\mathbb R)\to(P,\leqq)$, where $O(f)\leqq O(g)$ whenever $\lim_{x\to 0}\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}=0$. One can verify such partial order is well-defined. Then consider the ideal $S'$ generated by $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^n\subseteq S$. Then for arbitrary $g\in S'$, the proposition

$$
(O(g)\leqq O(f_1))\lor(O(g)\leqq O(f_2))\lor \cdots \lor (O(g)\leqq O(f_n))
$$

holds ture. Now we shall prove the existence of $g\in S$ such that

$$
(O(f_i)\leqq O(g))\land (O(f_i)\neq O(g))
$$

holds true for every $i\in \{1,\ldots ,n\}$.

The pivot is to understand the non-existence of function in $S$ with the lowest damping rate. The construction is easy. Consider

$$
g(x):=\sqrt{\max_{1\leq i\leq n}(|f_i(x)|)}.
$$
