Q: Not all Abelian groups are additive groups of a ring.

1. Show that if there is $u \in  R$ with $2u = 1_R$ then $R$ has no element of order $2$ in its additive group. Hence deduce that the quotient group $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ is not the additive group of a ring.
2. Is the quotient group $\mathbb R/\mathbb Q$ the additive group of a ring?

> The following is the proof of $1$: If $2x=0$, then $x = x1 = x(2u) = 2xu = 0u = 0$, so $(R, +)$ has no element of order 2. Since $(\frac12+\mathbb Z)+(\frac12+\mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z\implies \frac12+\mathbb Z$ has order 2 in $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$.
> Let $R$ be a ring with additive group $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ and $1_R = e + \mathbb Z$, then $2(\frac e2+ \mathbb Z) = e + \mathbb Z$, contradiction.

A: Question: Does the additive group $A:=\{x+\mathbb Q\mid x\in \mathbb R\}$ admit a ring structure with an identity?

Answer: Yes. Since $|\mathbb R|=2^{\aleph_0}=2^{\aleph_0}-1=|A|$, $A$ and $\mathbb R$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb Q$-linear spaces, given by the bijection
$$
\varphi:\mathbb R\overset \sim \to A, rs\mapsto ra\quad (\forall r\in \mathbb Q).
$$
Define the multiplication on $A$ by
$$
a\cdot a'=\varphi (\varphi ^{-1}(a)\cdot \varphi^{-1}(a')).
$$
Then we can verify

* $(a a') a''=\varphi (\varphi ^{-1}(a) \varphi^{-1} (a')) a''=\varphi ^{-1}(a) \varphi^{-1} (a')\varphi ^{-1}(a'')$, thus $(aa')a''=a(a'a'')$;
* $\varphi (1)a=\varphi(1\varphi^{-1}(a))=a$, thus $\varphi(1)a=a=a\varphi(1)$;
* the commutativity also holds,
* $a(a'+a'')=aa'+aa''$, by $\mathbb Q$-linearity of $\varphi$ and $\varphi^{-1}$.
